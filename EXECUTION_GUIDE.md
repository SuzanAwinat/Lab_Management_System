# Lab Management System - Step-by-Step Execution Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up, running, and using the Comprehensive Cloud Lab Management System.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### Required Software
- **Python 3.8+** - [Download Python](https://python.org/downloads/)
- **Node.js 16+** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
- **Modern Web Browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

### System Requirements
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: At least 2GB free space
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)

## üöÄ Step 1: Download and Setup

### 1.1 Clone or Download the Project
```bash
# If you have Git installed
git clone <repository-url>
cd lab-management-system

# Or download and extract the ZIP file to a folder
```

### 1.2 Verify Prerequisites
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version
# Should show Python 3.8.x or higher

# Check Node.js version
node --version
# Should show v16.x.x or higher

# Check npm version
npm --version
# Should show 8.x.x or higher
```

## üîß Step 2: Backend Setup

### 2.1 Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/lab-management-system
```

### 2.2 Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv lab_env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
lab_env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source lab_env/bin/activate
```

### 2.3 Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
pip list
```

### 2.4 Initialize the Database
```bash
# Run the Flask application to create database
python app.py
```

You should see output similar to:
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
